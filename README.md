# Depth-First-Search-DFS---River-Crossing-Logic-Puzzle
In this project, we'll implement the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm in Java. We'll use DFS to solve the Missionaries and Cannibals and Jealous Husbands river-crossing puzzles. The goal is to safely navigate the characters across the river following specific rules. These puzzles highlight problem-solving techniques in artificial intelligence.
